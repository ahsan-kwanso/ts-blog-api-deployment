will see that ts ignore lines
will make models in ts, this is i guess the most difficult and important as well because changing my models is creating lot of issues in my services
will resolve other parts as well


add return type to services as well

refactor the code
further add return types -> doing this after services work move to utils and validators to see if there's any room for improvement, then move to connections and models, after doing all of this move to frontend
separate the interfaces



modify the connection
modify the models accordingly
test your application as well
then use eslint to configure more errors

Now I will keep only those requests that I am actually using on frontend, or keep all for practise purposes
